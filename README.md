## Data Sources

This tool uses data from multiple sources:

- **DAFNEE database for Ecology and Evolution**: We gratefully acknowledge the [DAFNEE database](https://dafnee.isem-evolution.fr/) which provides comprehensive information about journals in the fields of Ecology and Evolution.
- Custom curated data for Neurosciences and other biology fields.
